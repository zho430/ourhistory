Let's write down the great events of history!

No matter what your race or faith,
you can write down what you know about important things 
that may affect the world and send them to us, 
just in accordance with the agreed format.

Let future people know that you live in today's view of this matter, 
such a little bit excited!

For example:
20180601	China
		Happy children's day
		I feel the most important thing is to be happy.
		Author:zho430

20180530	Papua New Guinea
		The interstellar migration ship was invented
		I think this just is an example.It doesn't mean to look down on the country's creative potential, just because it has a longer name.
		Author:zho430

20000101	Country/Region
		The great events
		I think .../I consider ...(End with .)
		Author:your name

Now, you got it! Let's git it!
